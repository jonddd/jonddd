ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jonddd ! Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate pursuing a bachelor in computer science based in Singapore.

My GitHub contains past (and current) projects, some of which are for academic purposes if not purely out of curiosity and personal enjoyment. Please credit me by linking my GitHub profile if you wish to use or adapt my work!

I enjoy working on challenging puzzles and strive to build functional and relevant solutions to real world problems.
