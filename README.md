👋 Hi, I’m @jonddd ! I’m currently an undergraduate pursuing a bachelor in computer science based in Singapore.

My GitHub contains past (and current) projects, some of which are for academic purposes if not purely out of curiosity and personal enjoyment. 
I enjoy working on challenging puzzles and strive to build functional and relevant solutions to real world problems.
